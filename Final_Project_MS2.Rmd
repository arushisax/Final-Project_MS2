## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
#The first project I examined was Ethnicity-Industry-Indiana. While this dataset looks like it was properly cleaned, I found it difficult to discern exact trends. For example, in the first chart when  I click on "Yugoslavia" under Ethnic Descent and "Paper Manufacturing" as my industry, I see the map populate with certain colors which I believe correspond to the population density of Yugoslavic immigrants by county. I am not sure how industry is demarcated on this map, however. I think the author could have improved this map by either simplying variables (reducing them) or by adding better hover and color functionality.
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
